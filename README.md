My first attempt to create a page with React. Great experience :).
# About
This will is my preparation for an interview. While I am rehersing web building topics I want to create a set of very short articles. When someone is wrighting something and thinking how to write this knowledge, content is better memorized. 
There will be a theory corner, allowing user to read about some topics, and a quize section with questions about js, css, html, and hopefluy more :)
